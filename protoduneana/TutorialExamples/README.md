Example of a simple LArSoft module.

Instructions for this code are available on the CERN Tutorial page:
https://indico.cern.ch/event/575069

You will find there how to:
- produce root files with sim->reco outputs
- prepare a new module and config files for the framework
- build the module and run on your events
- access configuration parameters in the module code
- access data product (reco outputs) in the module
- access associations between data products
- match MC truth corresponding to the reconstructed object
- validate configuration parameters

Please, see the tutorial materials, there is full info and limks
to in-depth descriptions of all touched topics.
